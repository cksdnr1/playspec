# Independent implementation plan review

Reviewed the artifact against current entry points, storage and failure paths; prior authoring intent is not evidence.

The contract distinguishes informational output declarations from enforced deliverables. Requirements must fail before transaction preparation; normal status and replay remain read-only. Canonical boundaries use the established containment helper.

| Dimension | Earned/max | Evidence |
|---|---|---|
| Correctness/requirements | 29/30 | Acceptance cases identify the observed failure and required behavior. |
| Code/contracts | 24/25 | Design names existing entry points and compatible integration points. |
| Failure handling | 19/20 | Rejection and recovery behavior specified before mutation. |
| Testability | 15/15 | Concrete positive, negative and compatibility cases listed. |
| Scope/dependencies | 9/10 | Bounded to this audit finding; dependencies stated. |

Score: 96/100
Blockers: none
Residual uncertainty: filesystem/platform behavior must be checked by the implementation tests; docs alone do not prove execution.
